## Building, Testing, and Installation

You'll need the following dependencies:
* meson >= 0.48.2
* gobject-introspection
* libgee-0.8-dev
* libgirepository1.0-dev
* libgtk-3-dev
* valac

Run `meson build` to configure the build environment:

    meson build --prefix=/usr

This command creates a `build` directory. For all following commands, change to
the build directory before running them.

To build granite, use `ninja`:

    ninja

To install, use `ninja install`

    ninja install

To see a demo app of Granite's widgets, run `granite-demo` after installing it:

    granite-demo


## Documentation

Documentation for all of the classes and functions in Granite is available
[on Valadoc](https://valadoc.org/granite/Granite.html)

The additional requirements for building the documentation are:

* valadoc
* gtk-doc

To generate gtk-doc and valadoc documentation for this project, pass the
additional `-Ddocumentation=true` flag to meson, and run `ninja` as before.
