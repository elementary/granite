     * CompositedWindow is an invisible window without decorations or background.
     *
     * It is useful for handling different situations where the user has to
     * "pick" something or select an area on the screen, although it can be used in other scenarios too.
     * Most of the times the window will act as a surface to receive mouse / key press events from the user.
     *
     * CompositedWindow does not and will not try to set any default size. You are responsible to
     * set it's size to e.g: the window's //screen// size to have the window cover the enire //screen// area.
     *
     * Note that you should provide a way for the user to exit the window since it's invisible.
     * You can do that by connecting to {@link Gtk.Widget.key_press_event} signal and seeing if
     * e.g: the user pressed an Escape key. You should always {@link Gtk.Widget.destroy} the window after
     * it's not needed.
     *
     * Do not forget to call {@link Gtk.Widget.show_all} to actually start receiving events.
